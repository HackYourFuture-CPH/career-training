Based on previous iterations, we address a standard hiring process and look under the hood of a hiring process at a larger company. From there, we extrapolate to medium-sized and small companies and how their hiring processes might differ.

### The Corporate Hiring Process

The corporate screening & hiring process (perfect world scenario) explained with the concrete example of a large Danish tech employer in Copenhagen.

#### Hitting the apply button
What happens at the hiring company after you hit "apply" on an a job ad?

        1. First 2 weeks - roughly 30-40 applications get looked at
        2. Should I use "easy apply" on Linkedin?
        3. Apply early! Managers are eager BUT expectations are high initially
        4. (Seldom perfect matches exist) - revisions & compromises keep happening in the following weeks
        5. Applicant Tracking Systems. ATS exist, but all applications are screened by a recruiter
        6. It's an ongoing process

#### First Interview: 
Recruiter or Hiring Manager schedules or calls the candidate.
2 main things are screened for: relevant experience, salary, motivation.

        1. For HYF - why are you in DK? Long or short term?
        2. Language (English or Danish too poor)
        3. Big misalignment
        4. 80% likelihood to proceed
        5. Ability to learn fast
        6. How to prepare: think of examples of this!
        7. Personal story & family background
        8. e.g. Pregnancy - if it shows, ideally mention it. (for startups this can be a bigger concern)
        
#### Second Interview: 
If the Hiring Manager is happy, there will be a technical assignment

        1. Can be a take home assignment, or standardized as Codinggame, Hackerrank or Coderbyte.
        2. Do it as soon as you can (but familiarise yourself with the platform)
        3. References! Know HYF mentors or alumni in the company? Mention them!
        4. Evaluated by Hiring Manager & a Senior/ PO.
        5. They deselect the less good candidates
        6. Ask for feedback!
        
#### Third Interview: 
Interview about working preferences with team members

        1. Based on Personality type tests & working preference
        2. No rejection is about you, but about a fit for the specific team
        3. "What do you need to focus at work?"
        4. Feedback preferences
        5. Be honest
        
#### Contract offer or rejection
        1. How to handle rejection
        2. Use it as a learning process
        3. Ask for honest feedback to improve

        2. Must fit with CV/ consistent
        3. chronological backwards

        8. Use the top 1/3 of the CV & BIO text
