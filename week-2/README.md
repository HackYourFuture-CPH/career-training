# Career Training - Week 2

The goal of this session is to give every student feedback on their CV, Linkedin profiles and GitHub pages ("the Jobseeker Toolkit") in order to make them most attractive to recruiters. We will also cover the differences between what Startups, Medium-sized companies and larger Corporations look for in their screening processes, so you can best adapt your "Jobseeker Toolkit" to fit these individual preferences.
