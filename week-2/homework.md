## Do
- Add a small [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) project to your GitHub profile: You can choose between [this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db) or [this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8). (but you can also do both - good practice 🙃)
- Create an account on **Hackerrank** and take the [React Basics certifcation](https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-verification/react_basic)
- Add the certificate on Linkedin ;)
- Update the readme.md file of your **Mealsharing app**. Here's a good [example](https://github.com/DanJecu/meal-sharing-app)
- Be aware that your Mealsharing App must be deployed & working. This is a requirement to join the Final Project.

- ⚠️ On the **Thursday** after this class you will also receive another assignment, which will be used for the **Technical Mock Interview** session ([Career Training Week 3](/week-3/README.md). The challenge will be posted in your Slack channel. ⚠️
