## Github homework:
Separate some of the homework projects and apps into their own repositories. Perform this as a combination of copy/pasting from your HW repo and git commands - so you practise handling git too. You will need to look into `git clone`, `git remote add` and some other commands. 
Each should have a comprehensive title and a nice short description. As a minimum, you should have separate repositories for these:
- Spirit Animal name generator
- hyfBay shop
- The movies filtering (add a simple UI at some point)
- Fastest Presser
- Weather App
- Giphy Search
- Git Search
- To Do app

### How to submit the homework

Please send the following to Christopher on Slack:
- The reslt of your two personality tests
- A link to your GitHub page
- A link to your CV with sharing rights set to "edit"
