# Lesson Plan

### Interview
- The host (usually a mentor) will explain the process and set the agenda for the in-person meeting or call
- The first interview will start with a small introduction round just like a real interview
- The interviewee will be asked to give a short demo of their submitted work
- The interviewers will start asking questions (both general questions and specific questions to the work)
- The interviewers should write down the feedback and share the feedback at the end
- At last, the interviewee will be asked how this process went, what their input could be
- If itâ€™s not the last participant, the interviewee will now switch to the interviewer role and continue the process
